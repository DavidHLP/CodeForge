# Cache Protection Optimization Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for optimizing cache usage in the SpringOJ project by leveraging the existing protection mechanisms. The goal is to enhance the current cache implementation to automatically apply protection strategies (penetration, breakdown, avalanche protection) and improve overall system resilience and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Cache Protection Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cache system to automatically apply appropriate protection mechanisms based on cache access patterns, so that I don't need to manually configure protection for each cache operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a method is annotated with @RedisCacheable THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze access patterns and apply appropriate protection mechanisms
2. WHEN cache penetration risk is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically enable bloom filter protection for the cache key pattern
3. WHEN cache breakdown risk is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically apply distributed lock protection for hot keys
4. WHEN cache avalanche risk is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically apply TTL randomization and cache warming strategies
5. WHEN protection mechanisms are applied THEN the system SHALL log the protection strategy decisions for monitoring
6. WHEN multiple protection mechanisms are needed THEN the system SHALL coordinate them through the CacheProtectionService
7. WHEN protection configuration changes THEN the system SHALL dynamically adjust protection strategies without service restart

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Cache Key Analysis

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to analyze cache key patterns and access frequencies to automatically optimize protection strategies, so that system resources are used efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache keys are accessed THEN the system SHALL collect access frequency and pattern statistics
2. WHEN a key pattern shows high miss rates THEN the system SHALL automatically enable penetration protection with bloom filters
3. WHEN a key shows high concurrent access THEN the system SHALL automatically enable breakdown protection with distributed locks
4. WHEN multiple keys share similar expiration times THEN the system SHALL automatically apply avalanche protection with TTL jittering
5. WHEN access patterns change THEN the system SHALL adapt protection strategies accordingly
6. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL prioritize protection for the most critical cache keys
7. WHEN protection effectiveness is measured THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on protection success rates

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Cache Annotation Processing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want enhanced cache annotations that automatically configure protection mechanisms based on method characteristics, so that I can specify protection requirements declaratively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN @RedisCacheable annotation includes protection hints THEN the system SHALL apply the specified protection mechanisms
2. WHEN method parameters indicate high-risk scenarios THEN the system SHALL automatically enable appropriate protection
3. WHEN method return types are complex objects THEN the system SHALL optimize serialization and apply breakdown protection
4. WHEN cache TTL is short THEN the system SHALL apply avalanche protection with TTL randomization
5. WHEN cache keys use dynamic expressions THEN the system SHALL analyze key patterns for protection optimization
6. WHEN method execution time is long THEN the system SHALL apply breakdown protection to prevent cache stampede
7. WHEN annotation processing fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default protection strategies

### Requirement 4: Protection Strategy Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure protection strategies globally and per-service, so that I can optimize cache protection based on specific application requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system starts THEN the system SHALL load protection strategy configurations from application properties
2. WHEN global protection settings are defined THEN the system SHALL apply them as defaults for all cache operations
3. WHEN service-specific protection settings are defined THEN the system SHALL override global settings for specific services
4. WHEN method-level protection settings are defined THEN the system SHALL override service and global settings
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use safe default protection strategies and log warnings
6. WHEN configuration changes at runtime THEN the system SHALL apply new settings to new cache operations
7. WHEN protection strategies conflict THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using predefined priority rules

### Requirement 5: Cache Protection Metrics and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive metrics on cache protection effectiveness, so that I can monitor system health and optimize protection strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN protection mechanisms are active THEN the system SHALL collect detailed metrics on protection effectiveness
2. WHEN penetration protection is triggered THEN the system SHALL record bloom filter hit/miss rates and false positive rates
3. WHEN breakdown protection is triggered THEN the system SHALL record lock acquisition times and cache rebuild statistics
4. WHEN avalanche protection is triggered THEN the system SHALL record TTL distribution and cache warming success rates
5. WHEN protection failures occur THEN the system SHALL record failure reasons and fallback strategy usage
6. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL expose them through actuator endpoints for monitoring tools
7. WHEN thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and automatic protection strategy adjustments

### Requirement 6: Dynamic Protection Strategy Adaptation

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the cache protection system to automatically adapt to changing load patterns, so that protection remains effective under varying conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL automatically strengthen protection mechanisms
2. WHEN cache hit rates drop below thresholds THEN the system SHALL enable or strengthen penetration protection
3. WHEN lock contention increases THEN the system SHALL optimize breakdown protection strategies
4. WHEN cache expiration patterns cluster THEN the system SHALL increase TTL randomization for avalanche protection
5. WHEN protection overhead becomes significant THEN the system SHALL optimize protection strategies to reduce impact
6. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize protection for critical cache operations
7. WHEN adaptation decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log the reasoning and effectiveness of changes

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Cache Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the protection optimization to work seamlessly with existing cache operations, so that I don't need to modify existing code to benefit from protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing @RedisCacheable methods are called THEN the system SHALL automatically apply appropriate protection without code changes
2. WHEN existing RedisUtils operations are used THEN the system SHALL provide optional protection through configuration
3. WHEN cache operations use custom keys THEN the system SHALL analyze key patterns and apply suitable protection
4. WHEN cache operations have custom TTL THEN the system SHALL respect existing TTL while applying protection optimizations
5. WHEN cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL ensure protection mechanisms don't interfere with fallback strategies
6. WHEN multiple cache operations run concurrently THEN the system SHALL coordinate protection mechanisms efficiently
7. WHEN backward compatibility is required THEN the system SHALL maintain existing cache behavior while adding protection
